My Name is Richard Duschnig, 

Originally I'm from Austria but I decided to continue my studies in Hungary when my progression in Austria came to a grinding halt after going to programmers school. After four long lonely years I met my wonderful girlfriend in Pécs and we had a great time together, but then a sudden change happened. She left Pécs to study in Sopron, what I first belived it to be a minor issue. Soon I realised my mistake, I underastimated the effects the distance would have on our relationship, so a desicion had to be made.
